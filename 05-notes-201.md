# HTML & JS Readings

## HTML & CSS Book

### Chapter 5: Images

#### Storing images on your site:

- create a folder for images to be stored in

#### Adding images:

- < img>: is an empty element (no closing tag)
- src: tells the browser where it can find the image file
- alt: provides a text description which describes the image if you cannot see it. 
- title: provides additional information about the image. will display if you hover over.

#### Where to place images in  your code:

- will affect how it is displayed
  1. before a paragraph
     - paragraph starts on new line after image
  2. inside the start of a paragraph
     - the first row os text aligns with the bottom of the image
  3. the image is placed between the words of the paragraph that is appears in.

#### Three rules for creating images

1. save images in the right format: jpeg, gif, png
2. save images at the right size: same width and height it will appear in on the website
3. measure images in pixels.

* HTML5 Figure and Figure Caption

- < figure>: contain images and their caption so that they are associated.
- < figcaption>: allows a caption to be added

### Chapter 11: Colors

#### CSS3: Opacity

- opacity. rgba 
  - adjusted in decimals.

* HSLA

- background-color: hsla(0, 0%, 78%)
- hue between 0-360 degrees
- saturation as percentage
- lightness as percentage

- *example colors start on page 259*

### Chapter: Text

- can be split into two groups:

1. those that directly affect the font and it's appearance
2. those that would have the same effect on the text no matter what font you were using

- typeface will usually only display if the user's computer has that typeface.
- page 271 has a reference to techniques that offer a wider choice of type face
  - typeface is subject to copyright!
- if designing on mac you should check how type face is rendered on PC
- the default size of text in a browser is 16 pixels.

- setting font in pixels is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intend.

#### More Font Choice

- @font-face: allows you to use a font even if it's not installed on the computer a person is browsing.
  - it allows you to specify a path to copy.
  - path to the font downloads it on the user's computer
  - check the the license permits this!!
- @font-face {
  font-family:
  src: specifies the path to the font
}

##### Font Formats

- you will need to supply the font in several variations.
- Font Squirrel provides the CSS code for the @font-face rule.

##### Uppercase & Lowercase

- text-transform:
  - uppercase
  - lowercase
  - capitalize

##### Underline & Strike

- text-decoration:
  - none
  - underline
  - line-through
  - blink *animates the text to make it flash on and off*

##### Alignment

- text-align
  - left: easiest to read
  - right:
  - center:
  - justify: indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing block.

##### Indenting Text

- text-indent: tells you to indent the first line of a text
  - you can use pixels or ems to specify how much you want it to indent

##### CSS3: Drop Shadow

- text-shadow: creates a drop shadow.
  - you cane make the shadow lighter or darker, which creates different effects.
  - it takes three lengths and a color
  1. indicates how far to the left or right the shadow will fall
  2. indicates the distance to the top or bottom that the shadow will fall.
  3. specifies the amount of blur that should be applied to drop shadow
  4. Color of the drop shadow

##### First Letter of Line

- :first-letter, :first-line
  - you can specify different values for the first letter or first line of text inside an element
  - these are not properties
  - they are pseudo-elements
    - you specify the pseudo-element at the end of the selector and then specify the declaration

##### Styling Links

- :link, :visited
  - will change the color of the links that have been visited
  - :link 
    - allows you to set the styles for links that have n ot yet been visited
  - :visited

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF - which image format to use and when?

### TL;DR

- use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or clour and intensity is smooth
- PNG any image that need transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. 
- GIF for images that contain animations

### Compression

- all forms of data on the internet is compressed
- compression can be of two types:
  1. lossless- possible to reconstruct og image from compressed image 
  2. lossy- data loss, irreversible
- JPEG is a lossy compression
- PNG is a lossless format using deflate compression. no data is lost, and no compression artifacts are introduced.
  - retain higher quality than JPEG
- GIF is a lossless image
  - mainly used for animations

### Transparency

- indicates something that is completely invisible
- JPEG is no suitable for transparency
- PNG supports transparency 
- GIF support transparency by declaring a single colour in the palette as transparent.

### Colors

- JPEG can support 16 million colours
- PNG images mainly have two modes:
  1. PNG8 can support 256 colours, simple shapes
  2. PNG24 can handle up to 16 million colours, high quality complex logos and shapes with rounded corners and transparent background.
- GIF limited to 256 colors. 

### Animation

- Only GIF support them
