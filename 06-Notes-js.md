## JS

* What is a programming language?
  * telling a computer what to do using features that computers have available to them. 
  
- HTML is content
- css is look
- Javascript is behavior
  
  - Syntax is more apporachable. Characters are more traight forward for a programming language. 
  - Creating boxes, adding data, talking to another computer such as a submit box or Netflix.

### Fundamental concepts

- Data types
  - string: group of text characters (numbers included) used to represent natural language, like a sentence
  - number: a quantitative value that represents all integers and decimals, and fractions
    - 1 or 1/2 or 4.5 or -1, 40000(no coma)
  - boolean: true and false
    - truthiness and falsiness javascript can evaluate certain things without being set as true or false
  - null and undefined

- Browser Behaviors - pre-built
  - Print text to the console
  - prompt user with a input box
  - Making http requests.
    - http is protocol that passes requests
- make decisions based on conditions
- You can work right into console
- the word "let" allows the word and lets you change variables. = gives it data and then it becomes a string
- let is Javascripts keyword and is a good default
- type always better
- Javascript is loosely tyed which means we can change what type a variable has
- semicolons are option, but should be consistent - JS lets you choose

## Variables

'let name  = 'Jacob';

if (age >= 31) {
    document.write('You're old!')
} else { (age <= 31)
    document.write(Too young!')
}

let content = document.getElementById('content-1');
console.log(content);
// the value that contains the text data
content.innerText = age;
