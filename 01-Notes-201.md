# Introductory HTML and Javascript

## HTML Book

### Chapter 1

Structure

- Structure helps readers understand content
- Headings and subheadings relfect hierarchy of information
- HTML describes the structure of pages
- html code is often in blue and the text is black
- typical structure is :

< html>
  < body>
    < h1> Main heading < /h1>
    < p> Maybe intro, and could be split< /p>
    < h2> Sub Heading < /h2>
    < p> Sub headings help follow structure < /p>
    < h2> another sub heading < /h2>
    < p>< /p>
  < /body>
< html>

- elements are made up of tags <>
- closing tags have a slah in the front </>
- Each element tells the browser about something about the information that sits inbetween each opening and closing tag
- the html tag is important so it tells the page what code it is using.

< body> - everything inside this element is shown on the browser
< head> - often before body, contains info about the page < title> is usualy inside the head. The title gives the page a name like in a tab.

Attributes 

- Attributes tell us about elements 
- They apear on the openeing tag and are tow parts a name and a value separated by =

example:

< p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

lang is language and en-us is the attibute value which is English.

### Chapter 8

- HTML

- There have been several versions of each browser to view web pages.
- There are things that HTML could do, that you now do in CSS.
- XTHML10 was released in 2000 and intorduced strict rules about writing marup.
  - every element needs a closing tag
  - attribute names have to be in lower case
  - all attributes require a value
  - every element that was opened inside another element should be closed in the same element.
- HTML5 is a work in progress.
  - Authors do not need to close all tags and new elements and attributes will be introduced.
  - Not all features will be visible to older browsers.

- Doctypes
  - since there are several versions of HTML each web page should begin with a < !DOCTYPE html> delcaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.
  - The DOCTYPE will also help the browser render the page correctly

- Comments in HTML
  - Use <!-- this is a comment --> If you want to add a comment that isn't visible in the browers.
  - Adding comments in to your code is important so you can come back later and remember what you were working on.
  - They can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.
  - You can also comment out blocks of code so they aren't seen in the browser.

- ID Attribute
  - Every HTML element can carry an id attribute. < p id="pullquote">
  - They are used to identiy that element from other elemnts on the page.
  - It's value sshould start with a letter ot an underscore.
  - Important that no two elements on the same page have the same value, otherwise the value is no longer unique.
  - Giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it differently from any other instance on the page in CSS.
  - id attributes can be used to allow javascript to work with the particular elemtn.
  - id attribute is the global atribute because it can be used on any element.

- Class Attribute
  - Rather than uniquely identiifying *one* element within a document you will want a way to identiy several as being diffferent elements on the page.
  - You might want some paragraphs of text that have info that is more imprtnat than others and want to distinguish the elements.
  - The value of the class attribute should describe thc lass it belongs to.

- Block Elements
  - Elements that appear to start on a new line in the browser window. 
  example: < h1> < p> < ul> < li> 
- Inline Elements
  - Elements that appear to continue on the same line as neighbhoring element
  exammple: < a> < b> < img>

- Grouping Text & Elements in a Block
  < div>
  - allows you to group a set of elemtns together in one block level box
  - yoyu'd creat ea div element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site, logo and nav.
  - Using id or class attribute on the < div> elemtns means you can creat CSS style rules to indicate how much space the < div> should take up on the screen, and chance the appearance of the elements.
  - < div> can also make it easier to follow your code because it holds each section of the page.
  - adding a comment after the div closing tag can be helpful.
  < span>
  - acts like an inline equivalent of the < div>
  - it can contain a sction of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
  - it can contain a number of inline elements.
  - < span> is commonaly used to control appearance of the content using CSS.
  - class or id attribute is often used with span elements to explain purpose of the span element and so CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes.

- iframes
  - A litle window cut into your page so that you can se contents of another page. example: Google Maps on a page.
  - the content of an inline frame can e any html page.
  - < iframe> elements
  - attributes for < iframe> element:
    - src: specificies the URL of the page to show in the frame
    - height: specificies height of the iframe in pixels
    - width: specifies width of the iframe in pixels
    - scrolling: will not be supported in HTML5. Allows you to scroll if the page inside the ifram is bigger than the spae you have provided.
    - frameborder: will not be supported in HTML5. indictaes whether the frame should have a border or not.
    - seamless: in HTML5, a new attribute. Applied where scrollbars are desired.
- Information about your pages
  - < meta>
    - meta element lives inside the head element.
    - it tells search engines about your page like who created it.
    - it is an empty element that uses attributes to carry information.
    - the most common attributes are the name and content attributes which are used together to specifcy poroperties of a page.
    - common defined values are, description, keywords, robots, author, pragma, exprires.
- Escape charachters page 193

### Chapter 17

- HTML5
- Layout elements and their uses
- offer helpful alternatives to < div>
- how to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
- HTML5 sleements are easier to follow, and can help the author describe the structure of the page.
- header and footer elements are used for the main header or footer than are on the top or the bottom of the page, or for a article or section within a page.
- each article or section element can have its own header and footer elements t hold that information to that part of the page.
- < nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site.
- < article> element acts as a container fr any selection fo apage that could potentially be syndicated.
- if a page contains severa articles than each article would live inside it's o wn article element.
- a blog post might live inside an article element and each comment on the artile coud live inside its won child article element.
- < aside>
- has two purposes but depends on whether it's inside an article element or not.
- when inside and article element is should contain information related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. example: pullquote or glossary
- when the < aside> is outside of an article element it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire oage. examlpe: links to other sections of the ist, a list of recent posts, search box.
- < section>
- groups related content together and typically each section woud have it's own heading.
- a homepage may have several section slements to contain different sections of the page. example: new, top products, newsletter sign up.
ecuase it groups related items, it might have several article elements that have a common theme or purpose.
- section can be used to split a long article up.
- should not be used as a wrapper for the entire page
- < div> is best for containing elements of the entire page.
- < hgroup>
- used to group a set of more than one < h1> through < h6> so they are treates as a single heading.
- < hgroup> slement could be used to contain both a title inside a < h2> and a subtitle within a < h3> element.
- < figure> < figcaption>
- used to contain an content that is referenced from the main flow of the article.
- the article should still make sense if the content of < figure> is moved elsewhere.
- should be used when the content references the element.
- example: images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code sampes, text that supports main body of article.
- < figcaption> provides text description for the content of the < figure> element.
- Sectioning Elements < div>
- < div> element will remain important to group related elements.
- Linking Around Block-Level Elements
- HTML5 allows eb authors to pace a < a> element around a block level element that contains child elements.

## Chapter 18

- Process and Design
  1. Know your audience
     - Invent fictional visitors for your website such as age, gender, where they are from, career etc.
     - This can help you solve problems or answer deisgn questions
     - Identidy motivations and goals for why they are coming to the site.
     - Identify what information they need to acheive their goals
  2. Starting Mapping your site
     - Use card sorting technique to group information and sort your site
     - Make a witeframe to show what ifnromation needs to go on each page, and work on the layout.
     - Wireframes are an important visual so you have a sketch of what information needs to go where as you are biulding your code.
     - Wireframes are also useful to show your vision to clients.
  3. Getting your message across
     - Prioritize what content needs to go on each page and what information should be readily available to your user. login? sale info? this info will depend on the site you are building.
     - Visual heirarchy refers to how your eyes perceive what they see. Visual contrast between items will signal what is recognized and processed first.
     - Being concise and selective with navigation will create a better user expereince over all.

## JS Book

### Chapter 1: ABC of Programming

- 1/a: What is a Script and How Do I Create One?
  - A script is a series of instructions. 
    - examples: recipe, handbook, manual
    - made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step
    - depends on how user interacts with the page
    - run different section of code in response to the situation
  - Writing a script
    - a computer needs to follow instructions everytime is performs a task.
    - define goal- what task do you want to acheive?
    - design the script- split goal into tasks, like a puzzle, use a flow chart, write the recipe
    - code each step
    - take time to design your script before coding!
  - Designing a script
    - use flow chart for highlievel view of tasks.
    - break task down into a sequence of steps.
- 1/b: How Computers Fit Into the World
  - Computers create models of the world using data.
    - Each physcial thing in the world can be represented as an object.
  - Objects represent physical things in the real world
    - Properties are the characteristics of an object, like name and value.
    - an event is what the object is doing. 
    - You can trigger events to specific things that happen in a section of code.
    - Methods represent how people or things interact with the object in the eal world. 
    - A mtheod can contain instructions that represent one task.
  - The document object represents an html page.
  - programmers write code to say "When this even occurs, run that code"
- 1/c: How Do I Write Script For a Webpage?
  - html<>: content layer, gives a page structure
  - css{}: presentation layer, rules the state of how the content is presented
  - javascript(): behavior files, change how the page behaves.
  - < script> elemnt is used to load the javascript into the page
  - it;s value is src whose value is the path to the script you created.
    - this tells the browser to find and load the script file.
    - the js file is a compeltely seperate file that you can link into the html page but it's best to be kept separate in it's own file.
