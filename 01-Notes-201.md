Structure

- Structure helps readers understand content
- Headings and subheadings relfect hierarchy of information
- HTML describes the structure of pages
- html code is often in blue and the text is black
- typical structure is :

<html>
  <body>
    <h1> Main heading </h1>
    <p> Maybe intro, and could be split<p>
    <h2> Sub Heading </h2>
    <p> Sub headings help follow structure </p>
    <h2> another sub heading </h2>
    <p></p>
  </body>
<html>

- elements are made up of tags <>
- closing tags have a slah in the front </>
- Each element tells the browser about something about the information that sits inbetween each opening and closing tag
- the html tag is important so it tells the page what code it is using.

<body> - everything inside this element is shown on the browser
<head> - often before body, contains info about the page <title> is usualy inside the head. The title gives the page a name like in a tab.

Attributes 

- Attributes tell us about elements 
- They apear on the openeing tag and are tow parts a name and a value separated by =

example:

<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

lang is language and en-us is the attibute value which is English.
