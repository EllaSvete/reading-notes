### Text Editor Notes ###

###### What is a text Editor?
- A text editor is a software that you download, that allows you to write and manage the text to build a website.
- It is one of the most important tools as an aspiring web developer.
- It's important to always be curious but text editors are all pretty similar and choosing one is very personal. 
- If you don't enjoy using it, then you probably shoudn't use it. 
- Important features to look for are: 
  - Code completion
  - Syntax highlighting
  - A variety of themes
  - A variety of extension options 
- Code completion create suggestions when you start typing - kind of like an autofill. It saves time, prevents errors, and can include closing tags so you are, in fact, writing code.
  - Emmett is an extension and can help you write code extremely fast and efficiently.
- Syntax highlighting is useful to color code your code, so you can easily find errors.
- Themes are important becasue it allows you to change the background screen of where you're writing code. These color changes can help to prevent eye strain and fatigue.
- Extensions are essential to the functionality of your text editor when you need it. 
###### Picking a text editor
- Our computers come with text editors, but these ready-available programs don't give us all the options we need for writing code. Becuase of this, you often find that there is no code completion. 
- NotePad++ is a free text editor for windows. Many developers swear by it because it has been around many years and has nearly all the necesities listed above.
- BB Edit is a text editor that has a free 30 day trial period and an option to purchase if you want acess to other options. 
- Visual Studio Code is made my Microsoft and runs on Windows, Mac and Linux computers. VS Code has a big following and also has all of the things to look for when choosing a text editor. 
- Atom also runs on all three computers and is free. It was created by the people at GitHub. 
- Brackets is created by Adobe and runs on all three computer systems. It only runs HTML CSS and Javascript, but other capabilities can be added through extensions. 
- Sublime Text is a premium software that costs $70, and is worth the bang for your buck no matter how advanced you are. 
###### What is an IDE?
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software.
- It is helpful to get familiar with a text editor before utilizing a IDE.

### Linux Tutorial Cheatsheet 1-3 ###
###### The Command Line
- The command line is also known as the terminal 
  - It is a text based interface to the system. You can give commands, and feedback will be given as you enter them. 
- Line 1
  - presents us with a prompt
   - we enter command - first thing you type. 
   - then, we have command line arugments. There must be a space between the command and the first command line argument. 
   - First command argument (-l) is also refered to as an option. 
   - Options modify behaviors of the command. 
   - Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).
- Line 2-5 
   - Outputs for running commands. 
- Line 6 
   - Prompt again
###### Opening a Terminal
- Termial > applications > utilities or command + space
- The shell is part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and look after you give it commands. 
- Bash refers to a shell
- To know which shell you are using, use echo $shell 
###### Shortcuts
When you enter commands, they are a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.

###### Basic Navigation
- pwd > Print Working Directory
  - Use this command to remind yourself where you are in the terminal
- ls > list 
  - With no arguments it will give a plain listing of current location 
  - ls[option][location] > square brackets mean items are optional > we can run command with or without them
  - (/etc.) tells ls to not list our current directories but list it's contents.
- Path > refers to a file or directory on the command line 
- There are 2 types of paths: *absolute* and and *relative*
- The top is called the *root* directory and is denoted by a slash (/)
  - This slash is how you can identitify absolute paths in relation to the directory
  - relatvie paths will not begin with a slash. They specify a specific location 
- ~ (tilde) > shortcut for home directory 
- . (dot) > reference to your current directory
- .. (dotdot) > reference to parent directory
- cd > stands for change directory

###### More About Files!
- Common Extensions > 
  - file.exe - an executable file, or program.
  - file.txt - a plain text file.
  - file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
- You can use the command file to find out what the file is 
-  whenever we specify a file or directory on the command line it is actually a path file[path]
-  Linux is case sensitive!
-  Command lines are also case sensitive
-  Don't have a space in file names unless it has quotes 'Holiday Photos' or \Holiday Photos
-  . (full stop) means the file is hidden > to hide a file you can have it begin with a . 
-  ls will not list hidden files
