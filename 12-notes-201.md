#### Easily Create Stunning Charts With Chart.JS

- a JS plugin that makes charts
- import script src='Chart.min.js
- create canvas element in html
- line chart:
- <canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
- create data in script tags

``` script

var buyerData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
			pointColor : "#fff",
			pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
			data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
		}
	]
}

```
- pie chart:
- canvas, then instantiate the chart
  - var countrie= document.getElementById("countrie").getContext("2 new Chart(countries)).Pie(pieData, PieOptions);
- pie chart is more simple than line chart, each section just needs color and value 

``` script

var pieData = [
	{
		value: 20,
		color:"#878BB6"
	},
	{
		value : 40,
		color : "#4ACAB4"
	},
	{
		value : 10,
		color : "#FF8153"
	},
	{
		value : 30,
		color : "#FFEA88"
	}
];

after pie data add options 
var pieOptions = {
  segmentShowStroke : false,
  animateScale : true
}

```

#### Basic usage of Canvas

- < canvas> only have two attributes, width and height
- set using DOM properties
- giving an ID makes it easy to identify
- requires closing tag
- getContext(); checks support
- funxtion draw (); is an event handler

#### Drawing Shapes with Canvas

- three functions that draw a rectangle:
  - fillRect(x, y, width, height)
    - draws a filled rectangle
  - strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
    - draws a rectangle outline
  - clearRect(x, t, width, height)
    - clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent
  - draw () function draws the rectangle using the three above functions

- beginPath()
  - creates new path
- Path methods to set different paths for objects
- closePath()
  - adds a stright line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path
- stroke()
  - draws the shape by troking outline
- fill()
  - draws shape by filling the path's content area
- closePath()
  - close shape by drawing straight line from current point to the start.
- moveTo(x, y)
  - draws a line between paths
- arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, counterclockwise)
  - Draws an arc which is centered at (x, y) position with radius r starting at startAngle and ending at endAngle going in the given direction indicated by counterclockwise (defaulting to clockwise)
- arcTo (x1, y1, x2, y2, radius)
  - draws an arc with the given control point and radius, connected to previous point by straight line

#### Styles and Color

- fillStyle = color
  - Sets the style used when filling shapes.

- strokeStyle = color
  - Sets the style for shapes' outlines.

  - ctx.fillstyle = 'orange'
  - for loop to draw grid of triangles
  - each a different color
  - strokeStyle changes colors of shapes' outline 
  - globalAlpha = transparencyValue
    - useful if you want to draw a lot of shapes on the canvas with similar transparency
  lineWidth = value
- Sets the width of lines drawn in the future.

- lineCap = type
- Sets the appearance of the ends of lines.

- lineJoin = type
- Sets the appearance of the "corners" where lines meet.

- miterLimit = value
- Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes.

- getLineDash()
- Returns the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.

- setLineDash(segments)
- Sets the current line dash pattern.

- lineDashOffset = value
- Specifies where to start a dash array on a line.

- lineCap: determines how the end point of every line are drawn. 

- butt
- The ends of lines are squared off at the endpoints.

- round
- The ends of lines are rounded.

- square
- The ends of lines are squared off by adding a box with an equal width and half the height of the line's thickness.

- lineJoin: determines how connecting segments in a shape are joined together.
- round
- Rounds off the corners of a shape by filling an additional sector of disc centered at the common endpoint of connected segments. The radius for these rounded corners is equal to half the line width.

- bevel
- Fills an additional triangular area between the common endpoint of connected segments, and the separate outside rectangular corners of each segment.

- miter
- Connected segments are joined by extending their outside edges to connect at a single point, with the effect of filling an additional lozenge-shaped area. This setting is effected by the miterLimit property which is explained below.
