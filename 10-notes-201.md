### Chapter: 10 Debugging

#### Execution

- know how the scripts are processed. 
- every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts.
  - global context 
  - function context
  - eval context

  - variable scope
    - global scope
    - function level scope
  - execution content & hoisting
    - each time a script enters a new execution there are two phases of activity:
      - 1. prepare
      - 2. execute
  - hoisting means you can call functions before they have been declared
  - assign a value to a variable that has not yet bee declared
  - each execution context also creates its own variable objects. 
- scope
  - lexical scope
    - linked to the object they were defined within. 
- understanding errors
  - if js statement generates an errors, it throws an exception
  - interpreter stops looks for exception handling code. 
  - if error is not handled tge script will stop processing the user will not know why.
- error objects
  - find where you mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.
  - when an error object is created it will contain: name-type of error, message-decsitoption, fileNumber- Name f the JS file, line Number- line of error.
- error objects continued: 460 & 46 !
- Debugging Workflow
  - where the problem is
  - what the problem is
  - console log!!
    - ensures script is running and writes the values/elements to console. 
- console.info - used for general information
- console.warn - used for warnings
- console.error - used to hold errors

- breakpoints 
  - pausing execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. Then you can check whats stored in variables at the point in time. 
  - in chrome select sources option
  - page 476
- exceptions - when you know code might fail
  - try{

  } catch (exception) {
    
  } finally {

  }
