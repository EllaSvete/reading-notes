# What is CSS?

* Stands for Cascading Style Sheets

* Allows you to create the style of a webpage.

* Language that describes how HTML elements look

* CSS is the only way you can visually adjust your website

## CSS Class Notes

- 'Rule': All the CSS styling properties and value that tells and element or a group of elemnents how to look. ex "I wish these words *looked* better
- 'Property': Something that an element uses to describe how it looks
- there is a very big list. You have to loook it up to figure how each property effects our elements. It goes inbetween curly braes or brackets
- 'Value': what you assign to a property. a single string ex. "relative" or "px". The other side of our colon. Sometimes there is more than one value, but you'll have to look up which properties allow multiple values
- 'Selector': Precedes rules of curly braces, is used to select one or more element in the HTML document. for example, instead of 'p' could be something like #intro.
- 'Curly Backets': The rule for our selectors is always within a set of these bracket {}
