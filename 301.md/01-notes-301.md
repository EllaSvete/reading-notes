# Class 1 Notes

## Things I want to know more about

- just excited to learn more about react and data manipultation 
- in the example I don't undertand how it knows to call it's self child 1, 2, etc

## Component-Based Architecture

- What is a “component”?
  - set of well-defined functionality that encapsules implementation as a higher level interface
  - a software object
  - interacts with other components
  - conforms to recommended behavior
  - unit of composition with specified interface
- What are the characteristics of a component?
  - encapsulate functionality and behaviors of a software element
  - reusability
  - replaceable
  - not context specific: can exist in different environments 
  - extensible: extended from existing components to provide new behavior
  - encapsulated: allows the caller to use its functionality and don't expose details of internal processes
  - independent: minimal dependencies on other components
- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
  - It ensures component reusability which increases reliability
  - reduced time in market.
  - ease of deployment
  - reduced cost
  - ease of development
  - reusable
  - modification of technical complexity: modifies complexity through the use of a component container
  - reliability
  - system maintenance and evolution
  - independent

### Principals of Component-Based design

- software system is decomposed into reusable component units
- each component has it's own interface; hides detailed implementation
- should be extended without making internal code
- do not need to depend on other components
- interaction can take the form of method invocations
- for a server class, use specialized interfaces to serve major categories of clients. 
- can extend other components and still offer its own extension points - allows plugin to another API

### Component-Level Design Guidelines

- attains names from the problem domain and ensures they make sense to everyone who views the model
- extracts business process that can exist independently
- recognizes independent entities as new components
- models dependencies from left to right
- model component dependencies rather than direct component dependency

## What is "props" and how to use it in React

- React is a component based library that divides UI into resuble pieces
- props pased data between components
- props stands for properties
- data props re being passed in uni-directional flow
- Props steo by step:
  - define attribute and value
  - pass to child component
  - render data
- you can assign aatributes values to html tags
  - using interpolation{};  you can do this in react
- you pass props liiike you would pass arguments to a functions
- render props object by using strin interpolation: {props}
  console.log(props);

``` js
 const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
  return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
};

// this is how to render text property with an interpolation
```

- Ticking clock rendering example: 

``` js
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

- the simplest way to define a component is to write a jS function
  you can use ES6 class to define a component too

  ``` js 
  class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
