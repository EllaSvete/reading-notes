## HTML & CSS Book

### Chapter 2

#### Text

- HTML has 6 levels of headings < h1> through < h6>
- < p> < /p> tags are used to surround paragraphs.
  - by defaults, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space in between. 
- < b> < /b> element makes bold
- < 1> < /i> element make italic
< sup> < /sup> element contain characters that should be superscript like, 4<sup>th</sup> or 3<sup>3</sup>
- < sub > < /sub> element is used to contain subscript like, H<sub>2</sub>0
- Whitespace collapsing refers to when the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other or if it comes across a line break.
  - These techniques make it easier to read code.
- < br /> adds a line break inside the middle of a paragraph
- < hr /> creates a break between themes.
- < strong> indicates the content has importance. It will show the element in bold
- < em> indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning. It will default in italic.
- < blockquote> used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
  - < p> element is still used inside blockquote.
  - don't used this element solely for indentation purposes
- < q> used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.
  - internet explorer doesn't default quotations with this element
- < abbr> abbreviations. an attribute is on opening tag to specify full term.
  - < p>< abbr> title="Professor">Prof< /abbr>
- < cite> used to cite a bok or film, not a name. Browser defaults to italics.
- < dfn> defining instance of a new term.
- < address> contains contact details about the author.
- < ins> show content has been inserted
  < del> shows content has been deleted
  - ins content is usually underlined and the del is usually crossed out.
- < s> indicates something is no longer accurate. Will be shown with a line through the center

### Chapter 10

#### Introducing CSS

- Imagine there is an invisible bo around HTML every element.
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line, like < h1>
- CSS allows you to create rules around each box.
- CSS works by associataint rules with HTML elements.
  - rules govern how the content of specifiec elements should be displayed.
    - Selectors: indicates which element the rule applies to. "The same rule can apply to more than on element if you separate the element names with commas."
    - Declarations: how elements reffered to in the selector should be styled. they are split into two parts (property and value) and are separated by a colon.
      - Declarations sit inside curly brackets.
      - Properties indicate aspects of the element you want to change; font color, border, etc.
      - Values specify the setting you want to use for the chosen properties. for example, what color you want.
- * example on page 234

- External CSS
  - < link> element can be used in an html document to find the CSS file.
    - It is an empty element: does not need a closing tag.
  - href: specifies the path to the CSS file
  - type specifies the type of document being linked to.
  - rel specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. the value should be stylesheet when linking to CSS file.
  - Why would you use more than one CSS file?
- Internal CSS
  - < style> the attribute in a HTML document that indicate the styles are specified in CSS.
  - usually sits inside the head element of the page.
- Selectors
  - Page 238!
  - case sensitive: must match element names and attributes.
- How rules cascade
  - If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence.
  - if one selector is more specific than others the more specific rule will take precedence.
  - !important can bea dded after any property value to show that it should take precedence.
- Inheritance
  - if you specify font family or color properties on the < body> element, they will apply to child elements. "inherited"
  - you can force properties to inherit values from their parent element by writing "inherit"

## Javascript Book

### Chapter 2

#### Basic Javascript Instructions

- Statements
  - a statement is a series of instructions and should end with a semicolon.
  - statements are intructions and each one starts on a new line.
  - statements in curly brackets are known as code blocks
    - green lines are statements
    - pink curly brackets indicate the start and the end of a code block
    - purple indicates the code that will run.
    - JS is case sensitive.
- Comments
  - writing comments is important to explain your code and make it easier to understand.
  - You can come back to it after several days and know what is going on.
  - /* */ is used to write comments that stretch over more than one line.
  - / / is used to write single line comments.
- Variable
  - a variable is where the script stores it's data.
    - variables help the script "remember" what the value is for things like wdith and height
  - You must declare you are going to use a variable.
  - var: variable keyword.
  - example: quantity; variable name or identifier.
  - camel case is used when the variable is more than one word "camelCase"
  - = is the assignment operator. It is used to assign the variable name to the variable value 
  example: quantity = 3;
    - undefined variable is when the value hasn't been assigned to a variable.
