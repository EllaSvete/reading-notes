#### Text

- HTML has 6 levels of headings < h1> through < h6>

  - by defaults, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space in between. 
- < b> < /b> element makes bold
- < 1> < /i> element make italic
< sup> < /sup> element contain characters that should be superscript like, 4<sup>th</sup> or 3<sup>3</sup>
- < sub > < /sub> element is used to contain subscript like, H<sub>2</sub>0
- Whitespace collapsing refers to when the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other or if it comes across a line break.
  - These techniques make it easier to read code.
- < br /> adds a line break inside the middle of a paragraph
- < hr /> creates a break between themes.
- < strong> indicates the content has importance. It will show the element in bold
- < em> indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning. It will default in italic.

#### Introducing CSS

- Imagine there is an invisible bo around HTML every element.
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line, like < h1>
- CSS allows you to create rules around each box.
- CSS works by associataint rules with HTML elements.
  - rules govern how the content of specifiec elements should be displayed.
    - Selectors: indicates which element the rule applies to. "The same rule can apply to more than on element if you separate the element names with commas."
    - Declarations: how elements reffered to in the selector should be styled. they are split into two parts (property and value) and are separated by a colon.
      - Declarations sit inside curly brackets.
      - Properties indicate aspects of the element you want to change; font color, border, etc.
      - Values specify the setting you want to use for the chosen properties. for example, what color you want.

- External CSS
  - < link> element can be used in an html document to find the CSS file.
    - It is an empty element: does not need a closing tag.
  - href: specifies the path to the CSS file
  - type specifies the type of document being linked to.
  - rel specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. the value should be stylesheet when linking to CSS file.
   - Why would you use more than one CSS file?
- Internal CSS
  - < style> the attribute in a HTML document that indicate the styles are specified in CSS.
  - usually sits inside the head element of the page.
- Selectors
  - Page 238!
  - case sensitive: must match element names and attributes.
