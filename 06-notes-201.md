# HTML & JS Readings

## JS 

### Chapter 3: Object Literals

#### What is an object?

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variable and functions take on new names.
- this object represents a hotel that has five properties and one method,
  - the object is in the curly braces and is stored in the variable hotel:
  var hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 25,
    gym: true;
    roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'subtle'
    <!-- ] Properties: these are variables -->

    checkAvailability: [function()]{
      return this.rooms - this.booked;
      <!--Method: This is a function -->
    }
  };

  - In JS:
    - variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or boolean
    - Arrays have a name and a group of values.
    - named functions have a name, and a value that is a set of statements to run if function is called.
    - objects consist of a set of name/value pairs

##### creating an object

###### Literal Notation

- easiest way to create objects
- example above ^
- strings live in quotes and arrays live in square brackets

##### accessing and object

###### and dot notation

- and dot notation is how to access the properties or methods
  var hotelName = hotel.name;
  var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();
- you can also use square brackets
  var hotelName = hotel['name];
  var roomsFree = hotel['checkAvailability']();
- commonly used for:
  - name of property contains special characters such as a dash
  - the name of the property is a number (should be avoided)
  - a variable is being used in place of property name
- *examples page 104&105*

### Chapter 5: Document Object Model

#### DOM

- Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can success and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window
- neither part of HTML or JS
  - is a separate set of rules. implemented by all major browser makers
  - covers 2 primary areas:
    1. Making a model of HTML page
    - DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using DOM Tree
    - DOM is an object model because the model is made of objects
       2. Accessing and changing html page
    - defines methods and properties th access and update each object in this model
    - DOM also, API
    - APIs let programs talk to each other.
    - DOM states what your script can ask the browser about the current page
    - how tot tell the browser to update what is being shown to the user.

- the model of a dom tree is a model of a web page when it loads the page.

- the document node:
  - every element, attribute and piece of text in the hTML is represented in it's own DOM node.
  - a document node is added which represents the entire page.

- element nodes:
  - elements such as a h1-h6 describe the structure of the page.
  - to access tree you start by looking for elements. 

- each node is an object with methods and properties.
- scripts access and update this dom tree, not the source html file

- attribute nodes:
  - opening tags of html elements
  - not children of the element
  - common to change the values of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules that affect their presentation

- text nodes:
  - once you have accessed the element node, you can then reach the text within that element. stored in it's own text node. 
  - cannot have children of an element
  - child of containing element. 
  - illustrates how the text node is always a new branch of the DOM tree

- working with the DOM tree:
  - locate the node that represents the element
  - use its text contents, child elements, and attributes. 

- 1.Access the elements
  - select individual element node
    - getElementById()
    - querySelector() - uses CSS selector and returns the first matching element.
  - select multiple elements (node lists)
    - getElementByClassName()
    - geElementsByTagName()
    - querySelectorAll() - CSS selector
  - Traversing between element nodes
    - parentNode
    - previousSibling / nextSibling
    - firstChild / lastChild
    - elements and element nodes are use interchangeable but when you say the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a node that represents the element.
- 2. Work with those elements
  - access/update text nodes
    - select element use firstChild property use Property to get what you need from the element
    - nodeValue:
      - this property lets you access or update contents of a text node
  - work with HTML content
    - One property allows access to child elements and text content 
      - innerHTML
    - just text content:
      - textContent
    - methods let you create new nodes, add nodes to a tree, remove nodes:
      - createElement()
      -createTextNode()
      - appendChild() / removeChild()
    - access or update attribute values
      - className / id
      - hasAttribute()
      - getAttribute()
      - removeAttribute()

- Methods that find elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries. 
  - when you need to work with an element more than once. 

- nodeLists are numbered like arrays but they are a type of object called a collection.
- live NodeList is when  you script updates the page and the NodeList is updated at the same time. 
- static NodeList is when your script updates the page, and the NodeList is not updated to reflect the changes made by the script.

- item() method will return an individual node from the NodeList.

1. select elements that have a class attribute whose value one and store the node list in a variable called elements. 
2. use the length property to check how many elements were found. if 1 or more are found, run the code in the if statement.
3. store the first element form the node list in a variable called firstItem.

- var elements = document.getElementByClassName ('hot')
  if (elements.length >= 1) {
    var firstItem = elements.item(0);
  }

- Array Syntax is preferred over the item () method because it is faster.

1. create a node list containing elements that have a class attribute whose value is hot, and store it in the variable elements. 
2. if that number is greater than or equal to one, run the code inside the if statement.
3. get the first element from the NodeList (it says 0 because index numbers start at zero)

- var elements = document.getElementByClassName ('hot');
  if (elements.length >= 1){
    var firstItem = elements[0];
  }

- traversing the DOM
  - how to select another element node in relation to the selected one
    - parentNode: finds the element node for the containing element
    - previousSibling/nextSibling: finds previous or next sibling node
    - firstChild/lastChild: find first or last child of the current element
    - some browsers recognize whitespace between elements as a text node

## Understanding the Problem Domain

- writing code is like doing a jigsaw puzzle
- building components of a bigger picture
- we are often not five the complete information about the problem domain. 
- programming is easy if you understand the problem domain
- take time to understand it before writing any code. 
- you can narrow focus onto a particular part of the problem 
- beneficial to take on part of the problem and fully understand it before expanding on the problem domain. 
- take time to talk to people about the problem domain. 

## what's the difference between primitive values and object references in JS

- The difference in their behavior affect how variable assignments are made, how equality operator get their results and how JS runs. 
- js supports 8 data types:
  - boolean
  - null
  - undefined
  - number
  - bigInt
  - string
  - symbol
  - objects

- arrays, functions, and fates are just objects under the hood

- primitive values cannot be changed or mutated, but the object references can be changed. 
- immutable data type is a string. 
- let letters = ['s', 'n', 'o', 'w']
  letters[0] = 'k'
  console.log(letters) // (4) ["k", "n", "o", "w"]
- since arrays are mutable you can alter them directly

- how dates should be converted to numbers:
- const dateA = new Date(0)
  const dateB = new Date(0)
  dateA === dateB // false
  dateA.getTime() === dateB.getTime() // true
