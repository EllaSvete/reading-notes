# Past present and future of local storage for web Applications

- if your client needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, yuo can embed your own database, invent your own file format or other solutions
- historicaly web apps  havent had this
- cookies were invented early in the development of the web.
- internet explorer was the only browser.
- userData is the DHTML Behaviors
- userData allows web page to store 64KB of data per domain
- Flash 6 from Adobe
- Local Shared Objects
- Gears from Google provides an API to an embedded SQL database on SQLite.
- HTML5 is a specification named Web Storage 
  - local storage or dom storage
- html5 storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally within client web browsers.
- nearly every browser supports HTML5 storage
- from JS you'll access HTML5 storage thourgh the localStorage object on the global window object
- function supports_html5_storage(){
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !==null:
  } catch (e) {
    return false;

  }
  }

  - you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 storage
  - if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}

- you can store data based on a named key
- you can retrieve data with the same key
- the key is a string
- Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.
- you can treat localStorage object as an associattive array using the getItem() and setItem() methods
- methods for removing the value for a give named key, and clearing the entire storaeg area. 
- interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
- removeItem() with non-existent key will do nothing
- propery to get the total number of values in the storage area, to iterate rhough all of the keys by index
- interface Storage {
  readonlu attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};
- If you call key() with an index that is not between 0â€“(length-1), the function will return null

- tracking changes to the HTML5 storage area
- when you set an ite, to it's existing value and then call clear() when there are no named keys, the stprage event will not fire because nothing actually changed in the storage area.
