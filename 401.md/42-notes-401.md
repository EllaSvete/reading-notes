# Reading Notes Class 42

## Dunder Methods

- special predefined methods you can use for your classes
- they start with `__`
- stands for double under
- allow you to emulate behavior of built in types

```{python}
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
4
```

- Dunder methods unlock the following features
  - Initialization of new objects
  - Object representation
  - Enable iteration
  - Operator overloading (comparison)
  - Operator overloading (addition)
  - Method invocation
  - Context manager support (with statement)

- `__init__` 
  - constructs account objects
  - takes care of setting up the object

- `__repr__`
  - official string representation of an object
  - how to make an object of the class

- `__str__`
  - informal string representation of an object for enduser

```{python}
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
```

- Iteration

```{ptyhon}
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
```

## Iterators

- `__iter__` dunder method
- the init method with link each RepeaterIterator instance to the Repeater object that created it. 
- the `__next__` reaches back into source repeater instance and returns the value 

- For in Loops
  - broken down:

```{python}
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```

- yuo can call iterator and it raises an StopIteration execption to stop an endles loop
  - signals youve exhausted all availble values in the iterator
- iterators use exceptiont to structure control flow
- if it keep requesting more values in the iterator itll keep raining StopIteration exceptions
  - they normall can't be reset after they have been exhausted

## Generators

- iterator:

```{python}
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```

- generator:

```{python}
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```

- calling a generator function doesn't run the functions
- creates and returns a generator object
- when a return statement is invoked inside a function 
- permantly passes control back to the caller of the function
- when yield is invoked, it passes control back to the caller of the function 
- only does so temporarily
- generator function doesn't have ti include any type of loop
- generator also has stop insedrtion error built in
- check by doing next(iterator)
