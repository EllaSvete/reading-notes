## Code Review

### garage band

- self: an instance method
  - because it does have a decorator
- cls: when it is called, the class will be brought along with it
- when things aren't defined under dundr innit they are class attributes
- self.name is setting a attribute on that instance of the class object
- str is a instance method
  - each instantiation of the instance attribute str will return the string with the instance of the class
- in each instrument class:
  - instrument = "guitar" is a class attribute

- doubled curly brace will make the curly brace you want in the f string to show up.
- inserting
  - start at the head
  - if youre a node what is your value
  - go to "old currents next"
  - if current.next is value of what youre looking for
  - 

- write tests that ask the question, does this work the way its intended?
