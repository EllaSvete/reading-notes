## Next.js

### Assets, Metadata, and CSS

- static assets
- manually handle
- ensure image is responsive
- next/image is extensions of the HTML <img> tag
- Next.js optimizes images on demand as users request them
- build times aren't increased
- height and width props should be defired rendering size
- aspect ratio identical to the sourcve image

- third party JS refers to any scrupts that are added from a third-aprty source
- scripts need to load and execute as ssoon as possible
- next/script is an extensions of the HTML script and optimized when additional scripts are fetched

### Reac Context

- allows us to pass down and consume data in whatever component we need in React App without using props
- greater when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application
- data should be placed onreact context that does not need to be updated often
- react context helps us avoid probelm of props
- props drilling is when you pass down multiple levels in a nested componetn
- Context is an API that is built into React
- createContext method

```{js}

import React from 'react';

export const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
      <User />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

function User() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Consumer>
      {value => <h1>{value}</h1>} 
      {/* prints: Reed */}
    </UserContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

- [step by step](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/)

- instead of passing props we can pass the entire context object to react.useContext
- context will have a value prop
- context is for passing down props to any of the children without having to do it to all children
- global state for all children
