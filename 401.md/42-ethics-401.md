# Class 42 Ethics in Tech

## Project Dragonfly, Google's Censored Cearch Engine

### Reflection

- This article is a great example of why it can be tricky for someone new in the job market. Working at Google would be an amazing opportunity with opportunities for growth, but I think it's becoming more an more important to align your job with your ethics to see change. It's inspiring that the employees have pushed so hard to become stakeholders and have a role in decision making. Company's often seek out candidates with ethical believes, and then don't follow those same guidelines. This is why I am weary of taking a job with a company like Amazon, Apple, or Google. I'm hoping to be apart of something that is making a positive change momentum. 

## Ethical Dilemmas Of Self Driving Cars

### Reflections

- This was an interesting article to read since it's a little outdated since we have self driving cars now. The point Melissa Cesfkin makes is interesting, because getting in the car with an uber driver or even a friend is giving up control and you are completely putting your safety into the hands of another. The idea question of who the car should save is really difficult and morbid to think about, and it all kind of comes to down to chance and possibly accepting that accidents will always be inevitable. Another thing to thing about with self driving cars, is the amount of people drive for a living. If we start replacing them with AI vehicles, so many people will lose their jobs which seems unethical as well. Personally, I think the focus shouldn't be on self-driving vehicles and more about how we can make electric vehicles affordable and accessible to everyone, and figuring out what to do with functioning cars that take gas.
