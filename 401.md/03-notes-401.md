### Read & Write Files in Python

What is a file?

- a file is made up of bytes used to store data
- byte files are used to translate into binary 1 and 0
- files contain 3 parts
  - Header: meta data about contents of file
  - Data: contents of file
  - End of File: spacial character that indicates the dner

File Paths

- Folder Pth: the file folder location on the file system where other folders are separated by a forward slash
- File Name: name of file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a person to indicate file type
- cwd: current working directory
- (..): move directories

Line Endings

- (LF or \n) to end a line

Character Encodings

- encoding of byte data
- an encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters.
- ASCII is subset of Unicode
  - they share the same numerical value
  - parsing a file with incorrect encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentations

Opening and Closing a File in Python

- to open:

```[python]
file = open('file.txt')
```

- always make sure a file is properly closed
- can lead to resource leaks

- to close:

```{python}
reader = open('file.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```

- or

```{python}
with open('file.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

- the with statement takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block even in cases of error.
- *use with statements as much as possible*
- use second positional argument, mode
  - is a string
  - 'r' is most common way to represent opening the file in read-only mode
  - 'w' open for writing
  - 'rb' or 'wb' open in binary mode

File Objects

- text files
- buffered binary files
- raw binary files

Reading Files

- .read(size=-1) : reads from the file based on the number of size bytes, if no argument passed then the file is read
- .readline(size=1) : this reads at most size number of characters from the line. Continues to the end of the line and wraps back around. If no argument passed, then the entire line is read
- .readlines() : reads remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list

Writing Files

- .write(string) : This writes the string to the file.
- .writelines(seq) :This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. Itâ€™s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).

- add 'b' to the character mode argument to read byte strings

- __file__ attribute is similar to __name__

Appending a file

- 'a' character for the mode argument
- working with two files"

```{python}
d_path = 'dog_breeds.txt'
d_r_path = 'dog_breeds_reversed.txt'
with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()
    writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))
```

- context manager
- __enter__() invoked when calling the with statement and __exit__ () is called when exiting the statement block

### Python Exceptions: And Introduction

- syntax errors occur when parser detects and incorrect statement
- >>> indicates where the parser ran into the syntax error
- exception error occur whenever syntactically correct python code results in an error

Raising an Exception

- use raise to fore an exception

AssertionError Exception

- you  can make an assertion to test if the condition is True
  - if True, can continue
  - if False, throw an AssertionError exception

- This will throw an assertionError as the last thing, and the program will come to a halt:

```{python}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 2, in <module>
AssertionError: This code runs on Linux only.
```

- try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exception
- Python executes code following the try statement as "normal" part of the program
- the code that follows the except statement is programs response to any exceptions in the preceding try

- The linux_interaction() can only run on a Linux system. The assert in this function will throw an AssertionError exception if you call it on an operating system other then Linux.
- You can handle an error with a pass
- file.log is another assertion error you can use when you open

The Else Clause

- the else statement can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions:

```{python}
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    print('Executing the else clause.')
```

- you can use the finally claus to clean up after executing your code

#### Summing Up

- raise allows you to throw an exception
- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception
- in try, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered
- except is used to catch and handle the exceptions that are encountered in the try clause
- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause
- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions
