# Class 18 Readings Notes

## Readings

### Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

- frequency analysis
- E is the most popular letter in english language
- you can use a frequency graph to deciphers letters
- plaintext is a term for unencrypted message
- encryption is scrambling data according to a secret key
- decryption is recovering data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- code cracking is uncovering data without knowing the secret by using clever techniques
- caesar cipher is the simplest most known encryption technique


### Video

- no such thing as completely secure
- cryptography translates to secret writing
- know the algorithm and number to shift by
- letter frequencies are persevered
- if e is x then x will show up the most
- permutation is the letter ordering
- the enigma rotor swapped letters
- decrypting and encrypting are the same sustem
- aes balances perfomance
- key exchange is an algorithm that doesn't send the key
- cryptography keeps everything secure
