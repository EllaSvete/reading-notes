## Permissions and Postgresql

### DRF Permissions

- Permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access
- run at the very start of the view
- use authentication information in the request.user and request.auth
- used to grant or deny access for different classes
- allow access to any authenticated user
- object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object aka a model instance

- permissions are run by REST framework generic views
- when youre using object level permissions youll also want to filter the queryset
- in order to restrict object creation you need to implement the permission check either in your Serialize class or override the perform

- setting the permission policy:

``{python}
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```

Per view: 

```{python}
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

- You can use @api-view decorator with function based views
