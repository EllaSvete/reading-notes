### Python Scope

- scope defines the area of a program inw chi you can ambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects

1. Global Scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code

2. Local Scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

- being able to access a name depends on where you define that name
- if you assign a value to a name inside a function that name will have a local Python scope
- if you assign a value to a name outside of all functions, then that name will have a gloabal python scope
- LEGB rule resolves names
  - local, enclosing, global, built-in

- Local Scope: the code block of any Python function. 
  - contains names that you define inside the function
  - will only be visible from the code of the function
  - created at function call not definition
  - Nonlocal scope:
    - only exists in nested functions
    - enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function
    - the names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions
- if you referene a given name, Python will look that name up sequentially in the local enclosing, global, and built in scope.
- Python first checks enclosing scopes from the innermost scope to the outermost scope

- Nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions
- nonlocal scopes is names you define in the enclosing Python scope

```{python}
>>> def outer_func():
...     # This block is the Local scope of outer_func()
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal var
...     # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
...     def inner_func():
...         # This block is the Local scope of inner_func()
...         print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
...
...     inner_func()
...     print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
...
>>> outer_func()
Printing var from inner_func(): 100
Printing var from outer_func(): 100
>>> inner_func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'inner_func' is not defined
```

- you can't modify names in the enclosing scope from inside a nested function unelss you declare them as nonlocal in the nested functions
- when you can dir() with no arguments you get the list of names available in your main global Python scope.
- when you assign a value to a name in Python
  - you create a new name
  - OR you update an existing name

- Inside inner_func(): This is the local scope, but number doesn’t exist there.
- Inside outer_func(): This is the enclosing scope, but number isn’t defined there either.
- In the module scope: This is the global scope, and you find number there, so you can print number to the screen.

### Big O

- Big O denotes how long the algorithm takes to do something
- Big O will give you worst case scenario
- with constatnt time complexity there is no change
  - compares different algorithms
- **will complete notes tomorrow**
