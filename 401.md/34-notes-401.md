## Configuring Django Settings

- Managing Django Settings: Issues
  - different environments
  - sensitive data
  - sharing settings between team members
  - Django settings are python code

- Different Approaches
  - no universal way to configure Django settings

  - settings_local.py
    - add allowed hosts
    - secrets are not in VCS
  
  - make a setting package with file structure:

```{python}
settings/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base.py
   ├── ci.py
   ├── local.py
   ├── staging.py
   ├── production.py
   └── qa.py
```

- python manage.py runserver --settings=settings.local  to set additional parameter
  - all environments are in VCS
  - easy to share settings
  - must find way to handle secret passwords
  - inheritance of settings can be hard to trace and maintain

- environment variables
  - Python os.environ
    - KeyError exceptions
    - convert types manually

- 12 Factor collections
  - Codebase
  - Dependencies
  - Config
  - Backing services
  - Build, release, run
  - Processes
  - Port binding
  - Concurrency
  - Disposability
  - Dev/prod parity
  - Logs
  - Admin processes
- each point describes the way to implement a specific aspect of the project

- Settings file is key! Setting it up correctly is good practice

## What is SSH: Understanding Encryption

- Secure Shell Protocol
  - allows user to access control and modify remote servers on the internet
  - SSH was created as a secure replacement for uncrypted telnet 

- on a mac SSH is simple
- commands:
  - ssh{user}@{host}
    - {user} represents account you want to access
    - {host} refers to the computer you want o access
  - then enter password
- uses encryption to ensure secure transer of information between the host and the client

- Symmetric Encryption
  - secret key is used for encryption and decryption
  - shared key or shared secret encryption
  - used to encrypt entire communication durng an SSH session
  - key exchange algorithm carries out creating a ckey

- Asymmetric Encryption
  - uses two separate keys
  - public and private
  - in order to authenticate a sender, a message is encrypted using their key
  - message can only be decrypted using that specific key

- Hashing
  - never meant to be decrypted
  - hard to reverse
  - if a client holds correct input they can generate the cryptographi hash and compare its value
  -
