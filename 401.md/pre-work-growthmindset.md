# Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your ethnical skills with deliberate practice

- Just because you program every day doesn't mean you get better at programming everyday
- playing not practicing
- Pay attention to what is pushing you out of you comfort zone
- in the professional tech world, opportunities to push yourself become more and more rare.
- Deliberate practice key ideas:
  - pushes you out of comfort zone
  - repeat often
  - feedback on results
  - mentally demanding
  - difficult
  - requires good goals
- this is a self taught business
- what challenges can you set yourself?

## The power of believing you can improve

- understand your learning curve
- abilities can be developed
- process can be more important than getting the correct answer

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- Grit is passion and perseverance for long term goals
- working hard to make future reality
- talent doesn't make you gritty!!
- grit is unrelated to measures of talent
- people with growth mindset don't believe failure is permanent
- be willing to fail!!

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- harder than ever before to not have career anxiety
- we are surrounded by SNOBS! lol
- materialism as rewards... interesting perspective!
- envy is a dominant emotion in society
- if you believe people deserve to be at the top, then you might also believe people deserve to be on the bottom
- people own success but also own their failure
- we fear failure because of judgement and ridicule
- we live in a society where we worship ourselves, not necessarily a god or higher power.
- you can't be successful at everything
- success has to identify the element of loss
- our ideas of success are not our own

## Emotional Intelligence

- Going to school in Olympia at the Evergreen State College has really taught me how to perceive myself and others and how my actions or words can have great effect on others as well. I have had two managerial positions which has also taught me a lot about communicating my thoughts and feelings as well as listening to my peers. I believe you will learn more through listening to people because you have the opportunity to understand their experiences which will improve how you interact with that person over all.

## Assessing Biases

- My strongest areas were What is a Bias and Meaningful Connections. I think i have a clear idea of what a bias is and that I seek to understand my colleagues even if we disagree. I love talking about ideas with people.
- My weakest area is Four Ways to Act. I have a hard time balancing self care and work because I really like to finish things that I have started and reach daily MVPs. I also think I could definitely do better listening to informative podcasts and getting involved with my community.
- The next few weeks I plan on working on my self care and not putting so much pressure on myself. I enjoy this bias worksheet because it is nice to check in with myself and be accountable.
