## Hash Tables

### Definition Sheet

- Hash: the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value tat could be used for either security or some other purpose.
  - takes a key and returns an integer
  - hash codes output is determines only by their input
  - should never have randomness

- Buckets: contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs
  - each bucket holds a key/value pair combination
  - the bucket starts at null when there is no entry

- Collisions: what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable
  - occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in the array
  - a perfect hash will never have any collisions
  - solved by changing initial state of buckets

- How do we use them?
  - hold unique values
  - dictionary
  - library

- Hashtables: data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or ucket have a key and a value
  - created from an array
  - once you have an array of the right size, turn the key into a nueric number value

- hash is the ability to encode the key that will amp to a specific location
  - lookup in O(1) time complexity

- To store values:
  - accept a key
  - calculate the hash of the key
  - use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
  - store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

- To read values:
  - accept a key
  - calculate the hash of the key
  - use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
  - use the array index to access the short LinkedList reprenting a bucket
  - search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matched the key you were given

- Add()
  - send the key to the GetHash method
  - when you determine the index of where it should be placed go there
  - check if something exists a that index, if not add key/value pair
  - is something exits, add the new key/value pair to the data structure

- Find()
  - takes in a key
  - gets hash
  - goes to index
  - iterate through the bucket to see if the key exits

- Contains()
  - accept a key
  - returns bool
  - contains call GetHash 
  - check the hastable if the key exists in the table given the index returned

- GetHash()
  - accept a key as a string
  - conduct the hash 
  - return the index of the array
