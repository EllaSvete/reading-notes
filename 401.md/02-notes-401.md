### In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

- Uni tests
  - pieces of code to exercise the input, output, and behavior of your code
- Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think and write tests first.

- input: name
- output: gender

```{.python}
def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘female’
```
