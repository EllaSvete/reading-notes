# Class 2 Readings Notes

## Readings

### In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

- Unit tests
  - pieces of code to exercise the input, output, and behavior of your code
- Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think and write tests first.
- Example test: given a name, return a gender
- input: name
- output: gender

```{.python}
def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘female’
```

- the tests are alive documentation
- be descriptive when naming tests
- separate tests folder from production code
- ex:

``` {python}
mymodule/
 — module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — another_module.py
tests/
 — test_module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — test_another_module.py
```

- Structure: AAA
  - Arrange: organize data to execute piece of code(input)
  - Act: execute code being tested (exercise behavior)
  - Assert: check result (output)

- The Cycle
  - write test and make it fail
  - write feature and make the test past
  - refactor the code
- Go through this cycle every time you add or modify your code

- TDD
  - craft software design first
  - code will be more reliable
  - practice!

### If name equals main

- if __name__ == "__main__":

- if interpreter is running the module as the main program, it sets special_name_variable to have a value "__main__"
- if imported from other module __name__ will be set to the module's name.
- it's name is available as a vlaue to __name__ global variable
- a module contains Python definitions and statements and has .py appended

```{python}
print ("Always executed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print ("Executed when invoked directly")
else:
	print ("Executed when imported")
```

- you can test whether your code is being run directly or being imported by something else
- every python module has it's __name__defined and if this is __main__ it implies that the module is being run by the user
- if script is imported into another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the module
- Python files can act as reusable modules or standalone programs
- if __name__=="main": is used to execute code only if th efile was run directly and not imported

### Recursion

- recursion is the process when a function calls itself directly or indirectly
- recursive functions are the corresponding function
- recursive algorithms can be solved quite easily.
- determine the sum of first n natural numbers:

```{python}
// first approach
f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +……..+ n
//second approach
f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
```

- Approach 2 the function "f()" is being called inside he function, this is a recursion and the function containing the recursion is called recrusive

- Base Condition
example: 

```{python}
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```

- n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller until base is reached
- represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problem
- add one or more base conditions that stop recursion
- we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1)
  - the base case for factorial would be n = 0, we return when ne = 0.
- if base case is not reached or undefined a stack overflow problem ay happen

- direct and indirect recursion
- direct recursive if calls the same function fun
- indirect if called on another function

- when any function si called from main() the memory is allocated to ti on the stck
- recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is put on top of memory allocated to calling function

#### Things I Want To Know More About

- Recursion! Still a little confused on this.
- Pytest installation did not work for me.
