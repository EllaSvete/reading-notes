# Data Structures

## Linked Lists

- nodes have 2 features
  - a value
  - next:
    - next: will always be a node or none
- circle is node, arrow is next
- head is the start of a list
- if a linked list has nothing else it has a head
- head will have particular type of data, decides where the start of the list is
- BiO(n) size of input is related to number of steps
  - process is same but length of linked list will vary
- creating a linked list means you must add a node
- adding to the beginning pre-prending
  - is an O(1) operation
  - always same number of steps
  - 2 steps, removing then adding
- typically add to the bginning because it is easier and takes less time
