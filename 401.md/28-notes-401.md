# Class 28 Reading Notes

## Django Tutorial: Working with Forms

- Django forms take a lot of the work that consists of making  html form
- action: resource/URL where data is to be sent to processing when the form is submitted
- method: the http method used to send the data: port or get
  - post method should always be used if th data is going to result in a change to the server's database
  - the get method should only be used for forms that don't change user data
- the role of the server is to render the initial form state either continuing blank fields or pre-populated with initials values. 
- uses same handling techniques for models
  - view gets request
  - performs actions required
  - generates and returns html page
  - server needs to be able to process data provided by the user and redisplay the page if errors
- Django Form Handling:
  - display default form the first time requested by user
    - can be blank or pre-populated
    - form is referred to as unbound because associated with any user-entered data
  - receive data from submit request and bind to form
  - clean and validate
    - sanitizes the input fields, converts to consistent python types
    - validation checks that the values are appropriate for the fields
  - invalid data re-displays the form
  - redirect user to another page once complete

- form class specifies the fields in the the form
  - provide methods for rendering itself in templates using predefined formats
- declare a form similar to a model

``` {python}
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```

- [Form fields and validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms)

- Url configuration:

```{python}
urlpatterns += [
    path('book/<uuid:pk>/renew/', views.renew_book_librarian, name='renew-book-librarian'),
]
```

- view has to render the default form when first called and then re-render with error messages

- Post is used to submit information to the server
  0 if request.method == 'POST' to identify validation requests and GET to identify initial form creation request
