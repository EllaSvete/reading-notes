# Class 26 Reading Notes

## Getting Started with Django - Intro

- each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model
- each attribute of the model represents a daabase field
- Django gives you an automatically generated database-access API

```{python}
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```

- the name of the table is automatically derived from some model metadata but can be overridden
- an id field is added automatically 
- create tbl sql is formatted using PostgreSQL
  - Django uses SQL tailored database backend 

- once models are defined Django needs to know they are being used
- when new apps are installed 
  - run manage.py migrate 
- clean save and delete are models API
- eah field in your model should be an instance of the appropriate Field class.

- URLconf deisngs python URLS.
- this modeul maps between URL path expression to Python functions
- can be constructed dynamically
- translates URLs according to the active language
- when a user requests a page to a DJango ppowered site, this is the algortithm
- urlpatterns 
  - django.urls.path() and/or django.urls.re_path() looks for variables url patterns
  - using a python function django imports and calls the given view
[Django URLs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/)

- Djangos template laguage is designed to strike a blaance between power and ease. 
  - designed to feel comfortable and easy to learn 
  - flexible and allow dvelopes to augments the template as needed
  - you can code within html
- a site shouldnt allow users to provide their own templates
- a template is rendered with context
- rednering replaes variables with their values which are looked up in context and execute tags
- a variable outputs a context which is a dict like object mapping keys to values
- variables re surrounded by {{}}

```{python}
My first name is {{ first_name }}. My last name is {{ last_name }}.
```

- django also provides a way to generate forms from existing data models
- django comes from a full featured authentication system
- allows you to easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely login
- automatic admin interface
- reads metadata
- offers full support for translating different languages 
- locale specific for fomatting dates, times, etc
- allows developers and template authors specifcy which parts of their apps should be tran;staed or formatted for local languages


## How Django works

- Python based web frame
- opensource! available on github
- Django software foundation maaintains django
- releases every nine months
- security releases montly
- corporate sponsers is how things like react and angualr get funded
- engineers at the company are paid to work on open source through community involement 
- there can be confusion around licensing aspects
- solo funding is when one person creates code and owns it and retains control of it
- Django started through non profit
- DSF
