## DS&A Graphs

- Graph:
  - nonlinear data structure that can be loked as a collection of vertices
  - vertices are also called nodes
- Edges:
  - line segments that connect nodes
- Vertex:
  - also called a *node* is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
- Edge:
  - a connection between two nodes
- Neighbor:
  - adjacent nodes connected via an edge
- Degree:
  - the number of edges connected to that vertex
- Undirected Graph:
  - each edge is undirected or bi-directional which means that the undirected graph does not more in any direction 
- Directed Graph:
  - has direction; each node is directed at another node with specific requirement of what node should be referenced next
- Complete Graph:
  - all nodes are connected to all other nodes
- Connected:
  - all vertices or nodes have at least one edge
- Disconnected:
  - some vertices may not have edges
  - it is possible to have standalone nodes or edges
- Acyclic:
  - a directed graph without cycles
  - a cycle is when a node can be traversed thourgh and potentially end up at itself
- Cyclic Graph:
  - has cycles
  - cycle is a path of a positive lenght that starts and ends at the same vertet
- Adjacency Matrix:
  - represented through 2-dimensional array
  - n vertices
  - n x n Boolean matrix
  - each row and column represents each vertex of the data structure
- Adjacency List:
  - most common way to represent graphs
  - a collection of linked lists od array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected
  - include the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex
- Weighted Graphs:
  - numbers are assigned to its edges
  - numbers are called weights
  - set the element to the 2D array to represent the actual weight between two paths
- Breadth First Traversal
  - start at a specific vertex/node
    - node must be specified!
