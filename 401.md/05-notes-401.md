## Readings

### Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

#### Definitions

- *Big O*: notation used the describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency

- *Running Time*: amount of time a function needs to complete

- *Memory Space*: amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions

- *Input Size*: the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm.

- *Working Space*: the creation of variables and reference points as our function performs calculations.

- *Constant Complexity*: no matter what inputs are thrown at the algorithm, it always used the same amount of time or space

- *Logarithmic Complexity*: represents function that sees a decrease in the rate of complexity growth, the greater our value of n

- *Linearithmic Complexity*: describe a growth rate of n by lgn. This represents complexity that grows with n, but also by lgn. Linearithmic functions grow faster tha input size n.

- *Quadratic Complexity*: an algorithm with complexity growing at a rate of input size n multiplied by n. Often seen in algorithms that have nested loops which perform iterative recursive logic on all values of n and immediately iterate or recurse again for each value n

- *Cubic Complexity*: a higher degree of what makes the quadratic complexity grow at such a high rate.

- *Exponential Complexity*: represents rapid growing complexity, such as our input size n.

- *Factorial Complexity*: time and space requirements grow extremely fast relative to input size

- *Worst Case*: the efficiency for the worst possible input

- *Best Case*: efficiency for best possible input size

- *Average Case*: efficiency for typical or random input size

- *Big Omega*: Best case

- *Big Theta*: Typical or random case
