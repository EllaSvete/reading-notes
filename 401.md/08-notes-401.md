### List Comprehensions

- list comprehension is a powerful and concise methods of creating lists in python that becomes essential the more you work with lists
- you need 3 ingredients for list comprehension to work
  1. expression we'd like to carry out 
  2. the object expression will work on
  3. we need an iterable list of objects to build new list
- the expression will determine what item is eventually stored in output list
- a compact way of creating lists
- faster than other methods

- creating a list with comprehensions

``` {python}
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

- the x represents each item in the list created by the range() method

- example 2

```{python}
# create a list using a for loop
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    # raise x to the power of 2
    squares.append(x**2)

print(squares)
output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# comprehension code

# create a list using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)

```

- this example shows that list comprehension reduces the code necessary to complete

- multiplying parts of a list
- adding ilter to list comprehension allows for greater flexibility.
- using filters we can select certain items from the list while excluding others

- examples of strings, arguments etc:
