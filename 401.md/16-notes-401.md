### What is Serverless Computing

- A cloud computing execution model:
  - automatically provisions the computing resources required to tun application code
  - scales those resources up or down in reponsed to demand
  - scales to zero when not running
- serverless describes the cutsomers experience with the servers
- they are invisible

- Function as a servers is the compute paradigm central to serverless
  - application code or containers run in response to events

- Pros
  - serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code
  - gives developers more time to optimize their front-end app functionality and business logic
  - pay for execution only
  - allows devs to use any language or framework
  - simplifies deployment and DevOps cycles
  - can be faster
  - highly available

- Cons
  - doesn't offer same savings for long-running processes
  - need to start from zero to serve a new request
  - debugging is more of a challenges
  - integrating with native services is where the value of cloud can be found
