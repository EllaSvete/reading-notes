### How to Run Linear Regression in Python

- scikit-lear is a python module for machine learning
- it contains a function for regression
- you can use this to explore keys of the dictionaries
- you can add thing to a panda data frame
- LinearRegression <tab> allows you to look inside the object
- Im.fit() : fits a linear model
- Im.predict() : predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
- Im.score() : returns coefficient of determination (R^2)
  - measure how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model
- train_test_splt splits data randomly 
- residual plots are a good ay to visualize errors in your data

### Linear Regression in Python

- regression searches for relationships among variables
- find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.
- the dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
- The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

- x explanatory
- y response variable
- a good fitting line can be used for prediction
- linear relationship between y and x
- E(y/x)= b0 + b1x
- observed values of y wont fall on the line
- use sample data to obtain estimated regression line
