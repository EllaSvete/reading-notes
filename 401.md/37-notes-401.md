# Readings Class 37

## React

- Simple react example

```{python} const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);

```

- introducing JSX

```{python}
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

- tag is neither a string nor a HTML
- called JSX 
  - syntaxx extension to JS
  - use with React to describe with the UI looks like
- JSX produces REact elements
  - explore rendering to the DOM
  - wrap JSX in {}

- JSX is an Expression Too
  - you can use if statments and for loops assign to variables accept it asa arguments and return it from functions

```{python}
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}

```

- react elements are ummutable
- once and element is created you cant change its roots or attributes
- root.render() to render elements

- components and props

- simplest way is to write a JS functionn
- class extends react component

```{python}
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
root.render(element);
```

## Tailwind

- style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in html

```{python}
<div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div class="shrink-0">
    <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-slate-500">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities (flex, shrink-0, and p-6) to control the overall card layout
- The max-width and margin utilities (max-w-sm and mx-auto) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally
- The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities (bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-lg) to style the card’s appearance
- The width and height utilities (w-12 and h-12) to size the logo image
- The space-between utilities (space-x-4) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text
- The font size, text color, and font-weight utilities (text-xl, text-black, font-medium, etc.) to style the card text

- implements custom component design
- better than inline
  - designs with constraints
  - responsive designs
  - can target states
  

## Next.js

- react framework
- puts team in the pit of success when building react apps
- ams to be best dev experience
- inuitive based routing system

- flexible
- scalable
- statically render websites
- react is like linux
- framework has evolved
- next.js makes it a bit easier
  - minifies JS
  - minimal html
  - cache and builds
- code splitting
  - scale app to thousand of pages
  - only loading JS of that page
- webpack
  - includes plug ins
  - ignoring dev only libs
- debugging is nice and shows shiwch line the error is 
- plugins are hard to get right
- vercel is ideal place to deply next.js projects
