## Using Models

- models define structure of stored data
- nce you choose your database you can just write your model structure and other code
- when designing models is makes sense to have separate models fro every object
- make models to represent selection list options rather than hard coding the choices into the website itself
- models are implemented in a subclass of django and can include fields, methods, and metadata
example of a model:

```{python}
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the URL to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```

- common field arguments:
  - help_text: provides a text label for HTML forms as described above
  - verbose_name: human readable name for the field used in field labels
  - default: callable object
  - blank: if True can be blank in forms
  - choices:  group of choices in field
  - primary-key: if True sets current field as primary key for the model

- you can declare model-level metadata for you Model bu declaring class Meta
- you can order based on a-z then something like dates

## Admin

- use models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, updates, and delete records
- admin.py and import admin
- to login to admin site you need to use;
  - createsuperuser
  - restart development to test the login
  - add link to create a record of that site
  - admin site is fairly easy to use and intuitive to non coders
- you can customize the interface to further alter data 

- you need a ModelADmin class to display admin interface
