# Class 11 Readings Notes

## Readings

### What is Jupyter Lab & Video

- enables you to work with documents and activities, text editors, terminals and custom components
- has code consoles to run code
- text editor include syntax highlightling and indenting
- support system terminals
- has many keyboard shortcuts
- you can use markdown 
- frame code with ``
- press y to cahnge to code
- shift enter will run the cell 
- notebook runs code on same kernal
- reset kernal by press 00
- 


### Numpy Tutorial

- Python data analysis package
- ; is used to separate values
- each record is separated by a new line
STEPS
- import csv library
- open the csv file
- create a csv.reader object
- delimiter=";" makes sure the records are split up on the semicolon character instead of the comma 
- print(file[:number]) will print the rows of data you desire
- Numpy works will multidimensional arrays
  - 2D arrays are known as a matrix
  - a matrix has multiple rows and columns
  - specifying row and column allows you to extract an element
  - number of dimensions is called the rank
  - each dimensions is called an axis
  - row is first axis
  - column is second axis
- numpy.array functions
  - passing in a list will automatically create and array
  - all elements in the array have to be the same type
  - list slicing will allow you to exclude the header row for example
  - dtype = np.float will allow you to convert each element to a foat
  - filename.shape you can see the nuber of rows and columns in the data
  - np.zero((3, 4)) creates an array with 3 rows and 4 columns where every element is 0
  - creating an array with zero elements is suseful when you need an array of fixed size but don't have any values yet
  - np.random.rand(3;4) will create and array were every element is random
    - useful for quickly checking code
  - numpy.genfromtxt used to read csv files into arrays
  - numpy is zero-indexed
  - adding a : allows you to select all elements in a column or row
