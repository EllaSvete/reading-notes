- linked list informs all the limitations of a list
- computer memory
  - doesn't know whats there at any given time
  - memory is 2D array of addresses
  - a linked lsit doens't have sequentional memory address

- when we're adding new nodes, we're reassigning the head, and the next to the previous head

- Big O

  - a list is a tack of books

- O(1) - always takes the same amount of effort
  - if you want to put a new book on top of the stack adding to the end of the list
    - put th ebook on top of the book
    - this is always the same

- O(n) - changes based on how many books their are
  - putting a book under the stack
  - you have to lift up the previous book
  - gets harder since you are lifting more books each time

- Big O

  - time complexity: how many steps or times the algorithm needs to run to complete a task

  - number of instructions: the number of input has an effort on how long the algortithm runs

  - Big O notation is always for a given worst care: the max possible steps to complete a function
