# inverting a binary tree

- what does the output look like
- would you like me to do this recusively 
- does it turn into a binary search tree

- base case no root let or right
- root.left = root.right

- base case is so the recursion doesn't continue
- setfor whenn we want it to end
- lowest output, finished when there is no children
- when left and right are none
- base case is kind of like an off switch

- take in the root
- swap children
- traverse  
  - keep algo high level

  - you can swap at the sam tme
