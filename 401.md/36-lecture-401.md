## Whiteboard Practice!!

- ALWAYS ASK FOR EXAMPLE OR TEST CASE

*Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.*

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

- ask clarifying question to determine if you are correct
- || bars represent absolute val
- abs in python to get absolute value
- when do you care about the value of a node and when do you care about the node itself
- root = a Node with a value of 8

- ask if its a numeric value vs a string
- output is an inteer with a value of an integer

- do the algorithm visually 

- we're going to have to hit all of the nodes!!!

- if working with a tree always ask if this it is BST
