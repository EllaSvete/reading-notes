# Class 7

## Code Review

- to be an exception it needs to be a sub-class

- Today's Challenge
  - kth value from the end of a linked list
  - extending and implementation (work in same file)
  - kth_from_end(k) method
  - takes in an integer
  - return node value that is k places from tail of linked list
  - ll.kth_from_end(k)
  - indexes going backwards
  - if 2 is arg and [2] index 2
  - what happens when the list is too short
    - raise an exception
  - what is linked list is single element

### Lab

```{python}
def calculate_score(dice):

score = 0

for num in dice:
  if num == 1:
  score += 100

return score

```

- dependency injection
  - passes in fake print
  - mock_print functions
  - mock_input functions
  - 

try: 
game_play_func()
except SystemExist:
real_print("")

return _find_differences

- make sure dundr init is across sub directory
- defalt rolling behavior

- python -m will get past import error
