# Class 9 Readings Notes

## Readings

### Dunder Methods

- dunder methods are predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes
- let you emulate behavior of built in types
- `__init__` is how to construct objects
- `__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of `__repr__` is to be unambiguous.

- `__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

- dunder ethods make the code iterable

### Statistics - Probability

```{python}
import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781
```

- simulate repeats the random() trials depending on how many time you'd like, returning the average number of heads across all trials. 
- firs data confirm that our average number of heads does approach what the probability suggests
- the average improves trails
- the more trials, the deviation away from the average decreases
- the model processes the code
- probability provides the theory and statistics provides the tolls to test the theory using data
- we have to mind the nature of our data
- the normal distribution refers to a particularly important penomenon
- the high point in statistical data represents the mean

```{python}
import csv
with open("wine-data.csv", "r", encoding="latin-1") as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f))
```
