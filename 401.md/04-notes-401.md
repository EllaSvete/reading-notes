# Class 4 Readings Notes

## Readings

### Classes and Objects

- Objects get their variables and functions from classes.
- classes are a templaete to creaet your obkects
- Basic class"

```{python}
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

- to assign a class to an object you do myobjectx = MyClacc()
- myobjectx is a variable

#### Accessing Object Variables

- access the variable inside the newy created object:

```{python}
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```

- output of this string is "blah"

- You can create multiple objects that are of the same class (same variables and functions defined)
- objects contain independent copies of variables defined in the class
- if we defined another object with the same name and change the string
- to access a function inside an object you do it the same way as accessing a variable

#### init()

- the init() function is called when the class is being initiated
- assigns values in a class

```{python}
class NumberHolder:

   def __init__(self, number):
       self.number = number

   def returnNumber(self):
       return self.number

var = NumberHolder(7)
print(var.returnNumber()) #Prints '7'
```

### Thinking Recursively

- Thinking recursively is breaking the problem into small chunks that you are able to solve. 
- if the first problems represents a simple case, solve it, if not divide and apply the same stratgy to them

- a recursive function is defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions
  - the function will cal itself and repeat its behavior until condition is met to return result
- each recursive call adds a stack frame until it reaches the base case, then unwinds as each call returns its results


### Maintaing State

- each recursive call has its own execution context
- maintaining state during recursion
  - thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call's execution context
  - keep the state in global scope
- calculate 1 + 2 + 3 + ....+10
- the state to maintain is current number adding, accumulated sum till now
- threading:

```{python}
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)

>>> sum_recursive(1, 0)
```

- Keeping the state in global scope:

```{python}
# Global mutable state
current_number = 1
accumulated_sum = 0


def sum_recursive():
    global current_number
    global accumulated_sum
    # Base case
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum
    # Recursive case
    else:
        accumulated_sum = accumulated_sum + current_number
        current_number = current_number + 1
        return sum_recursive()
  >>> 55
```

### Recursive Data Structures in Python

- a data structure can be recursive if it can be defined in terms of a smaller version os itself
  - a list
  - tree
  - dictionary
  - etc
- starting with an empty list you can generate any list by recursively applying the attach_head function
- the list data structure can be defined as:

```    +---- attach_head(element, smaller list)
list = +
       +---- empty list
```

- recursion can be a self-referential function composition
- apply a function to an argument, pass the result as an argument to second application of the same function, etc. 
- repeatedly composing attach_head with itself is the same as attach_head calling itself repeatedly

### Native Recursion is Naive

- lru_cache is a decorator that caches the results.
- we avoid recomputation by explicitly checking for the value before trying to compute it
- tail-call elimination can result in a stack overflow

### Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

#### Fixtures

- test suite
- each test checks different path of code
- parametrized tests handle tests with similar characteristics
- pytest.fixture decorator is how you define a fixture

- example function:

```{python}
def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
```

- in order to avoid the newline character from being places at the start of the line, you remove it from the string before reversing it and add \n in each returned string. 
- to test this function you'll need to pass it a file-like object
  - StringI0 works fr this
  - creates a fixture that will provide your test with the appropriate object at the right time
- pytest:
```{python}
@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```

- you can use a fixtures in a test and mentione it inside the test's parameters, then in the test you can access it by fixture name.

```{python}
def test_reverse_lines(simple_file):
   assert reverse_lines(simple_file) == ['cba\n', 'fed\n',
 â†ª'ihg\n', 'lkj\n']
```

- your fixture may act like data
  - not invoked with parens
  - but it is a function under the hood
  - executes every time you invoke a test using a fixture
  - the fixture can make calculations and decisions 

- you can decide how often a fixture is run
- this fixture will run once per test that mentions it 
- if you want to set up an object and use it multiple times without creating it again 
  - set up a scope
  - set up fixture to be module, it will be avilable throughout you tests but will execute only a single time
  - pass scope parameter to the pytest.fixture
- How do you know you've tested all the possible paths through those functions?
- pytest --cov
  - coverage report for every part of the Python library that your program used
  - provide an arugmen to --cov specifying which program you want to test
  - pytest --cov=mycode
  - coverage html
    - make it human readable
